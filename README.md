# DOM_SBA

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>This project is a simple tracker program. It is designed to recieve input about walks for my dog.  It takes the input provided in the form, displays it at the bottom as a list of walks with all the information, and updates the stats above in real time.  The data is not only displayed, but stored as an object, then pushed to an array so that it can be accessed and iterated over for the statistics and then used as needed.</p>

<p>This was a simple exercise to demonstrate DOM manipulation, form validation, event listeners, and data manipulation.</p>
